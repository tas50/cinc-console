 * positive queries (Chef/Solr handles those far more reliably than pure
 * negations) and subtract from the total:
 *
 *   missing      = total − (checked in within MISSING_AFTER_MS)
 *   unconfigured = total − (has a run_list OR a policy)
 *
 * These mirror `isMissing` / `isUnconfigured` in fleet.ts: a node that has
 * never checked in is absent from the "recent" set (so counted missing), and a
 * policyfile node has a `policy_name` (so counted configured). Boundary rounding
 * on the cutoff is immaterial — this is a fast first-paint estimate that the
 * authoritative sweep supersedes.
 *
 * Any failure degrades the whole thing to "unavailable" rather than throwing, so
 * the caller can hand this straight to a Suspense boundary as a never-rejecting
 * promise.
